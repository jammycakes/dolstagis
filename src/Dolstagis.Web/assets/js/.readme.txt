JavaScript organisation
=======================

To facilitate debugging, we take all responsibility for script minification.
Therefore, you MUST make sure that you include the unminified version of your
scripts here.

Scripts with names ending in .intellisense.js or .min.js will NOT be bundled
and will NOT be loaded into your page.

Organisation
============
Scripts common to all pages on the site should be placed in the root directory.
Scripts specific to one area of the site should be placed in a subdirectory
named after that area.
