About Dolstagis
===============

This repository contains some ideas for a web application framework for ASP.NET
MVC, inspired at least in part by Python's Django framework. It was originally
intended to be a "batteries included" option, ultimately offering out of the box
features such as authentication and  user management, an admin section,
commenting, and much more.

This project has been superseded by [Dolstagis.Web](https://github.com/jammycakes/dolstagis.web),
my new ALT.MVC framework.
